## Enhanced Features

### Triggers

#### Data Validation Triggers
1. **check_email_format**: Validates email format
2. **check_salary_range**: Ensures positive salaries
3. **check_hire_date**: Prevents future hire dates
4. **check_manager_hierarchy**: Prevents self-management
5. **validate_employee_salary**: Validates salary against job range

#### Audit Triggers
1. **employee_audit_insert/update/delete**: Tracks employee changes
2. **department_audit_insert/update**: Tracks department changes

#### Business Logic Triggers
1. **update_dept_employee_count**: Maintains employee counts
2. **generate_employee_email**: Auto-generates emails

### Views

#### Core Views
1. **employee_details**: Complete employee information with joins
2. **department_analytics**: Department performance metrics
3. **salary_analysis**: Job-based salary analysis
4. **management_hierarchy**: Manager-subordinate relationships
5. **geographic_distribution**: Location-based statistics

#### Analytical Views
1. **employee_tenure_analysis**: Tenure and seniority analysis
2. **department_cost_analysis**: Financial analysis by department
3. **top_performers**: Salary ranking analysis
4. **salary_gaps**: Compensation gap analysis
5. **promotion_candidates**: Employees eligible for promotion

### Indexes

#### Primary Relationship Indexes
- Foreign key indexes for all relationships
- Unique constraints on key business fields

#### Performance Indexes
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Text search indexes for names and emails
- Date range indexes for temporal queries

#### Analytical Indexes
- Salary range indexes
- Geographic indexes
- Audit trail indexes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries
```sql
-- Get all employees with details
SELECT * FROM employee_details;

-- Department summary
SELECT * FROM department_analytics;
```

### Analytical Queries
```sql
-- Top earners by department
SELECT department_name, full_name, salary 
FROM employee_details 
ORDER BY department_name, salary DESC;

-- Promotion candidates
SELECT * FROM promotion_candidates;
```

### Audit Queries
```sql
-- Recent changes
SELECT * FROM audit_log 
ORDER BY changed_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Data Integrity Features

### Foreign Key Constraints
- All relationships enforced at database level
- Cascade operations where appropriate
- Referential integrity maintained

### Check Constraints (via Triggers)
- Email format validation
- Salary range validation
- Date consistency checks
- Business rule enforcement

### Unique Constraints
- Unique employee emails
- Unique region/country/department names
- Prevent duplicate key data

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexing Strategy
- All foreign keys indexed
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Unique indexes for business constraints

### Query Optimization
- Views pre-calculate common joins
- Indexed columns for WHERE clauses
- Efficient sorting and grouping

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
```sql
-- Update statistics
ANALYZE;

-- Check integrity
PRAGMA integrity_check;

-- Vacuum database
VACUUM;
```

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check constraint violations
SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE operation = 'ERROR';

-- Monitor department employee counts
SELECT department_name, employee_count 
FROM departments 
WHERE employee_count != (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees 
    WHERE department_id = departments.department_id
);
```

## Testing the Database

### Constraint Testing
```sql
-- Test email validation (should fail)
INSERT INTO employees (..., email, ...) VALUES (..., 'invalid-email', ...);

-- Test salary validation (should fail)
INSERT INTO employees (..., salary, ...) VALUES (..., -1000, ...);
```

### Performance Testing
```sql
-- Test index usage
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN 
SELECT * FROM employee_details 
WHERE department_name = 'IT' AND salary > 5000;
```

## Extension Points

### Adding New Features
1. **Additional Triggers**: Add business rules as needed
2. **New Views**: Create specialized analytical views
3. **Custom Functions**: Add calculated fields
4. **Additional Audit**: Extend audit coverage

### Integration Points
1. **ETL Processes**: Use views for data extraction
2. **Reporting Tools**: Connect to analytical views
3. **Applications**: Use employee_details view for UI
4. **APIs**: Expose views as REST endpoints
