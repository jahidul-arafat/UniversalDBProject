## Overview
This is a comprehensive implementation of the Oracle HR sample database for SQLite, enhanced with:
- Complete foreign key relationships
- Data validation triggers
- Audit trail system
- Business logic triggers
- Performance indexes
- Rich analytical views
- Data integrity constraints

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### 1. regions

- **Relationships**: One-to-many with countries

#### 2. countries
- **Purpose**: Countries within regions
- **Key Fields**: country_id (PK), country_name, region_id (FK)
- **Relationships**: 
  - Many-to-one with regions
  - One-to-many with locations

#### 3. locations
- **Purpose**: Physical office locations
- **Key Fields**: location_id (PK), street_address, city, country_id (FK)
- **Relationships**: 
  - Many-to-one with countries
  - One-to-many with departments

#### 4. jobs
- **Purpose**: Job definitions and salary ranges
- **Key Fields**: job_id (PK), job_title, min_salary, max_salary
- **Relationships**: One-to-many with employees

#### 5. departments
- **Purpose**: Organizational departments
- **Key Fields**: department_id (PK), department_name, location_id (FK), employee_count
- **Relationships**: 
  - Many-to-one with locations
  - One-to-many with employees

#### 6. employees
- **Purpose**: Employee records (central table)
- **Key Fields**: employee_id (PK), first_name, last_name, email, job_id (FK), manager_id (FK), department_id (FK)
- **Relationships**: 
  - Many-to-one with jobs
  - Many-to-one with departments
  - Self-referencing for manager hierarchy
  - One-to-many with dependents

#### 7. dependents
- **Purpose**: Employee family members
- **Key Fields**: dependent_id (PK), first_name, last_name, relationship, employee_id (FK)
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with employees

#### 8. audit_log
- **Purpose**: Audit trail for data changes
- **Key Fields**: audit_id (PK), table_name, operation, old_values, new_values, changed_at
- **Relationships**: None (logging table)

## Enhanced Features

### Triggers

#### Data Validation Triggers
1. **check_email_format**: Validates email format
2. **check_salary_range**: Ensures positive salaries
3. **check_hire_date**: Prevents future hire dates
4. **check_manager_hierarchy**: Prevents self-management
5. **validate_employee_salary**: Validates salary against job range

#### Audit Triggers
1. **employee_audit_insert/update/delete**: Tracks employee changes
2. **department_audit_insert/update**: Tracks department changes

#### Business Logic Triggers
1. **update_dept_employee_count**: Maintains employee counts
2. **generate_employee_email**: Auto-generates emails

### Views

#### Core Views
1. **employee_details**: Complete employee information with joins
2. **department_analytics**: Department performance metrics
3. **salary_analysis**: Job-based salary analysis
4. **management_hierarchy**: Manager-subordinate relationships
5. **geographic_distribution**: Location-based statistics

#### Analytical Views
1. **employee_tenure_analysis**: Tenure and seniority analysis
2. **department_cost_analysis**: Financial analysis by department
3. **top_performers**: Salary ranking analysis
4. **salary_gaps**: Compensation gap analysis
5. **promotion_candidates**: Employees eligible for promotion

### Indexes

#### Primary Relationship Indexes
- Foreign key indexes for all relationships
- Unique constraints on key business fields

#### Performance Indexes
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Text search indexes for names and emails
- Date range indexes for temporal queries

#### Analytical Indexes
- Salary range indexes
- Geographic indexes
- Audit trail indexes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries
```sql
-- Get all employees with details
SELECT * FROM employee_details;

-- Department summary
SELECT * FROM department_analytics;
```

### Analytical Queries
```sql
-- Top earners by department
SELECT department_name, full_name, salary 
FROM employee_details 
ORDER BY department_name, salary DESC;

-- Promotion candidates
SELECT * FROM promotion_candidates;
```

### Audit Queries
```sql
-- Recent changes
SELECT * FROM audit_log 
ORDER BY changed_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Data Integrity Features

### Foreign Key Constraints
- All relationships enforced at database level
- Cascade operations where appropriate
- Referential integrity maintained

### Check Constraints (via Triggers)
- Email format validation
- Salary range validation
- Date consistency checks
- Business rule enforcement

### Unique Constraints
- Unique employee emails
- Unique region/country/department names
- Prevent duplicate key data

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexing Strategy
- All foreign keys indexed
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Unique indexes for business constraints

### Query Optimization
- Views pre-calculate common joins
- Indexed columns for WHERE clauses
- Efficient sorting and grouping

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
```sql
-- Update statistics
ANALYZE;

-- Check integrity
PRAGMA integrity_check;

-- Vacuum database
VACUUM;
```

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check constraint violations
SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE operation = 'ERROR';

-- Monitor department employee counts
SELECT department_name, employee_count 
FROM departments 
WHERE employee_count != (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees 
    WHERE department_id = departments.department_id
);
```

## Testing the Database

### Constraint Testing
```sql
-- Test email validation (should fail)
INSERT INTO employees (..., email, ...) VALUES (..., 'invalid-email', ...);

-- Test salary validation (should fail)
INSERT INTO employees (..., salary, ...) VALUES (..., -1000, ...);
```

### Performance Testing
```sql
-- Test index usage
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN 
SELECT * FROM employee_details 
WHERE department_name = 'IT' AND salary > 5000;
```

## Extension Points

### Adding New Features
1. **Additional Triggers**: Add business rules as needed
2. **New Views**: Create specialized analytical views
3. **Custom Functions**: Add calculated fields
4. **Additional Audit**: Extend audit coverage

### Integration Points
1. **ETL Processes**: Use views for data extraction
2. **Reporting Tools**: Connect to analytical views
3. **Applications**: Use employee_details view for UI
4. **APIs**: Expose views as REST endpoints
